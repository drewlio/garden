"""Garden watering application

This application appropriately waters a garden. Data is collected from:
    * Weather forecast from online sources
    * Soil moisture sensor measurements

For each watering session, weather and soil conditons are applied to a 
mathematical soil model to determine the additional water needed.

The amount of additional water is applied to an irrigation model to determine
the duration of watering session.

Water is applied by actuating a solenoid valve for the appropriate amount
of time.

Watering is repeated on a schedule. Soil moisture readings are collected 
continuously.

Include a file in this directory called ".env" with values such as the
following. (USER_AGENT with name and contact email is a requirement of the
National Weather Service. LATITUDE and LONGITUDE are used when fetching local
weather forecasts.)

USER_AGENT="YourName YourEmail"
LATITUDE=38.1234
LONGITUDE=-77.1234
